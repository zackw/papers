\begin{abstract}
The cross-origin CSS attack is a newly exploited browser vulnerability that allows the attacker to steal the user's secret content on an honest web site from a different domain. In this paper, we expose the cross-origin CSS attack, in which the attacker injects CSS strings into the target domain that contains the secret content, instructs the user's browser to link the document as an external style sheet, and then exports the secret content hidden in the imported style sheet to the attacker. This attack is constructed upon the lenient checking of content types and lax parsing of CSS in modern browsers. We detail existing server-side and client-side defense techniques and find shortcomings with each technique. We propose that browsers implement a stricter CSS parsing when the content type is broken, which can provide robust defense for cross-origin CSS attacks while addressing web site compatibility concerns.

\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction.

\section{Threat Model}
We define a precise threat model, the web attacker, for reasoning the cross-origin CSS attack. We assume that the attacker's goal is to steal the user's secret content on an honest web site from another domain.

\subsection*{Web Attacker (Data Theft?)}
A web attacker is a malicious principal who owns a domain name, e.g. attacker.com, and operates a web server. To study the browser's defense mechanisms, we assume that the user's browser renders content from the attacker's web site. In addition, the web attacker is given the ability to inject arbitrary strings into the target domain.

\begin{itemize}

\item{Attacker Abilities:}
The web attacker can send and receive network messages over network protocols of the attacker's choice, but only from its own machines. Typically, the web attacker operates at least one machine as an HTTP server, which we refer to as attacker.com. The web attacker has no control over the user's network connections. In particular, the web attacker cannot eavesdrop on unencrypted connections and steal session identifiers to hijack the user's session. Neither can the web attacker spoof network frames and impersonate the user to an honest web site.

\item{User Behavior:}
We assume that the user visits the attacker's web site in a popular browser. In practice, this assumption can be supported by several techniques for attacting users, e.g. buying web advertisements or sending bulk e-mail to encourage visitors. By rendering the attacker's content, the attacker can instruct the user's browser to fetch remote style sheets and also export data to remote servers. As long as the user's session with an honest web site haven't expired, the attacker can instruct the user's browser to issue requests with the user's cookies.

\item{Web Site Behavior:}
We assume that the attacker can inject arbitrary strings into a target domain that contains the secret content, which we refer to as victim.com. In practice, there are various methods to inject strings into the target domain, e.g. reflection of user controlled strings or via URL parameters. The ability of injecting CSS strings is weaker than injecting scripts into a target domain as in common XSS attacks, because scripts may be detected and blocked by client-side XSS filters.

\end{itemize}

There are a number of related threats that we do not consider in this paper, such as phishing, DNS rebinding, and XSS.

The web attacker is incapable of installing malicious software on the user's machine, otherwise, the malmare could replace the browser and bypass any browser-based defenses.

\section{Attacks}
In this section, we study cross-origin CSS attacks. First, we provide some background information. Next, we introduce cross-origin CSS attacks. Then, we discuss the restrictions for constructing this attack and suggest general areas that are exploitable. Finally, we construct an attack against a popular web site.

\subsection{Background}
In this section, we provide background information about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the same-origin policy (SOP), and content sniffing.

\subsubsection{Cascading Style Sheets}
Cascading Syle Sheets\cite{css} is a mechanism that lets web developers control the visual appearance of web documents using style sheet language. The design of CSS enables separation of document content from the visual appearance, including layouts, colors, and fonts. This allows web sites to preserve document structure while adjusting its appearance, e.g. switching on-screen views to printable views. Furthermore, documents are allowed to import external style sheets and let third parties to control a subset of the CSS rules.

In modern browsers, the CSS parser is actually very lax. The CSS parser will skip over any amount of invalid syntax in the style sheet until it finds the next valid rule. This is unlike the JavaScript parser that will abort on the first syntax error. A lax CSS parser gives the browser better compatiblity for supporting misconfigured web sites, but unfortunately opens opportunities for attackers and enables the cross-origin CSS attack in this paper.

\subsubsection{Same-Origin Policy}
The same-origin policy\cite{mozillasameorigin} is the main security mechanism in modern browsers that provides isolation of contents between unrelated web sites. The same-origin policy restricts contents to access resources only from the same origin, which applies to scripting interactions, i.e. XMLHttpRequest and Document Object Model (DOM)\cite{dom} access. In SOP, the origin is defined as the protocol, host, and port. The same-origin policy does not apply to fetching remote scripts or style sheets from a different origin.

\subsubsection{Content-Sniffing}
The HTTP Content-Type header indicates the type of the content that is transmitted using Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)\cite{mime} types such as text/html or image/jpeg. Browsers use this MIME type to determine how to handle the contents of HTTP responses. Some web servers fail to provide the correct MIME type in the Content-Type header, therefore browsers use content-sniffing algorithms to guess the correct MIME type by inspecting the contents of HTTP responses and override the server's MIME type. 

\subsection{Cross-Origin CSS Attack}
In a cross-origin CSS attack, the main objective is to steal the user's secret content on an honest web site from a different domain. The attacker is particularly interested in stealing any sensitive information of the user, or preferrably a secret CSRF token hidden in the document that may allow the attacker to hijack the user's session. 
(reference for csrf token?)
To describe the cross-origin CSS attack, we decompose the attack into three main steps: string injection, style sheet import, and data export.

\subsubsection{String Injection}
In order to steal content from a different domain, first of all, the attacker leverages the fact that browsers allows web sites to import style sheets. Given the ability to inject strings into the target domain which contains the secret content, the attacker may fool the user's browser to loading a carefully crafted non-CSS (e.g. HTML or XML) document as a valid style sheet resource. Normally, random text in a non-CSS document contains syntax errors and would not be parsed as valid CSS rules by the CSS parser. However, due to the overly lax parsing of CSS in modern browsers, portions of a non-CSS document with valid CSS syntax may still be successfully parsed and loaded as style sheet rules.

As an example, the attacker's injection string can be constructed based on common CSS properties that corresponds to string values, i.e. font-family, background-image, and list-style-image. If the attacker can control the text preceding and succeeding the sensitive content, suppose there is a sensitive string "SECRET", the target document can be crafted as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
Original:
<HTML>..SECRET..</HTML>

After injection:
<HTML>..{}BODY{font-family:"SECRET"}..</HTML>
\end{verbatim}
After injection, the crafted document appears to the user's browser as containing a valid CSS rule that declares the secret string as the font-family value for the "BODY" element. Once the user's browser loads the crafted document to the style sheet, the attacker can easily steal the secret string from the font-family style of the "BODY" element. Note that the seemingly redundant pair of brackets in the injection string resyncs the CSS parser to make sure that the evil CSS rule parses properly. In practice, there are several methods that may allow a web attacker to inject strings into the target domain, e.g. reflection of user controlled strings or via URL parameters.

\subsubsection{Style Sheet Import}
When the user visits attacker.com, the next step for the attacker is to instruct the user's browser to fetch the crafted document and load as a style sheet. In HTML, documents can import external style sheets from remote servers either using the CSS "@import" notation, or using the "LINK" element inside the "HEAD" element as the following: .
\begin{verbatim}
<HTML>
<HEAD>
  <STYLE TYPE="text/css">
    @import url(http://victim.com);
  </STYLE>
  <LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http://victim.com">
</HEAD>
</HTML>
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Data Export}
The attacker can then access the user's content that are hidden in the style properties imported from the remote style sheet.
The user's browser exports the secret content hidden in the loaded style sheets to the attacker.
JavaScript read currentStyle (IE), getComputedStyle;
cssText;
TABLE?
Send URL to evil server (No JavaScript)
