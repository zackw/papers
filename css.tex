\begin{abstract}
Cross-origin CSS attacks allow an attacker's web site to steal confidential information from another site by hijacking a user's existing authenticated session. The attack leverages an exception in the browser's security policy for style sheets to read other types of non-style content. We describe the conditions under which the attack applies and propose client-side defenses for the attack that will still allow the vast majority of web sites to function normally. We detail other client-side and server-side mitigation proposals and find shortcomings with each technique. Our defense proposal has been adopted by Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.

\section{Introduction}

The Web is rapidly becoming the single stop for all of our computing needs,
including information access, personal communications, office tasks, and
e-commerce. Faster, more standards-compliant browsers and improved development
frameworks have made the Web the platform of choice platform for delivering
rich, interactive experiences. Applications like Gmail and Facebook are
rapidly supplanting traditional client software.

One of the key features that has made the Web so successful is the same-origin
policy that allows users to safely interact with software written by anyone
--- even someone they do not trust. The browser limits interactions between
sites to by compartmentalizing them into ``origins'' that cannot easily read
each other's sensitive data. However, browsers have wisely added exceptions
where necessary to enable powerful cross-origin interactions. The cross-origin
hyperlink is the foundation that allowed search engines and social media to
revolutionize news, communication, and e-commerce. Cross-origin images have
allowed web applications to improve performance and reduce costs by
outsourcing their infrastructure to content distribution networks.
Cross-origin plugin embedding took this a step further by making the wildly
popular YouTube video service embeddable by bloggers. Cross-origin script
import has also played a key role in the success of the Web, allowing
publishers to optimize and monetize their content with tools like Google
Analytics and Google Adsense.

In this paper, we analyze another widely used cross-origin interaction: style
sheet import. Style sheets are used in Web applications to improve the
appearance of pages with color, layout, and more. They make the web an
efficient and attractive medium for presenting information. Because style
sheets can be imported across origins just like scripts and images, they
constitute an exception to the browser same-origin policy that prohibits sites
from reading content loaded from other origins. Browser vendors allow this
exception because they assume that sites will not transmit confidential information in style sheet format.

Browser vendors and standards bodies continue to push the limits of what is
possible with style sheets. The CSS specification~\cite{cssspec} introduces
new style sheet directives and even new syntax from time to time. All versions
of CSS, starting from CSS1, have required that user agents ignore certain
types of invalid style directives. This essential property of style sheets
provides forward-compatibility with future versions and allows experimental
vendor-proprietary extensions.

Unfortunately, this forwards-compatible parsing behavior presents a critical
security threat to the web. A malicious web site can load HTML documents as
style sheets, and extract the information that makes it through the browser's
lax HTML parser. This technique was first demonstrated by a Japanese
blogger~\cite{cssxss} to circumvent a victim web site's cross-site request
forgery defenses in Internet Explorer. In this paper, we describe additional
variations on the attack that work in all browsers and propose client-side
defenses. Our proposals have been adopted by Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari,
and Opera.

\section{Threat Model} \label{sec:threatmodel}
%We define a precise threat model, the web attacker, for reasoning the
%cross-origin CSS attack. We assume that the attacker's goal is to steal a
%victim user's secret content on an honest web site from another domain.

The threat model for cross-origin CSS attacks is a ``web
attacker''~\cite{jackson09thesis}, a malicious principal who owns a domain
name and operates a web server. To study the browser's defense mechanisms, we
assume that the victim user visits the attacker's web site. In addition, the
web attacker is given the ability to inject semi-arbitrary strings into the
target domain.
% 
% We do not require social engineering, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and we do not assume that the victim's machine has been compromised by malicious software;
% There are a number of stronger threat models that could  threats that we do not consider in this paper, such as phishing, DNS rebinding, and XSS.
% (more description...?)

\paragraph{Attacker Abilities}
The web attacker can send and receive network messages over network protocols of the attacker's choice, but only from its own machines. Typically, the web attacker operates at least one machine as an HTTP server, which we refer to as \texttt{attacker.com}. The web attacker has no control over the victim's network connections. In particular, the web attacker cannot eavesdrop on unencrypted connections and steal session identifiers to hijack the victim's authenticated user session. Neither can the web attacker spoof network frames and impersonate another user to an honest web site.
The web attacker is also incapable of installing malicious software on the victim's machine; otherwise, the malware could replace the browser and bypass any browser-based defenses.

\paragraph{Victim Behavior.}
We assume that the victim visits the attacker's web site with a popular browser. In practice, this assumption can be supported by several techniques for attacking users, e.g. buying web advertisements or sending bulk e-mail to encourage visitors. By visiting \texttt{attacker.com}, the attacker can instruct the victim's browser to fetch external style sheets and also export data to remote servers. As long as the victim's session with an honest web site haven't expired, the attacker can instruct the victim's browser to issue requests with the victim's cookies.
We do not assume that the victim behaves discloses any sensitive information
while on the attacker's site; merely rendering the attacker's web content
is sufficient.

\paragraph{Target Behavior}
We assume that the attacker can inject semi-arbitrary strings into a target domain that contains the secret content, which we refer to as \texttt{target.com}. We define the term semi-arbitrary strings as a subset of strings that may conform to CSS syntax to differentiate from fully arbitrary strings that may also conform to HTML syntax. The ability of injecting CSS strings is considered weaker than injecting HTML strings into the target domain, as in common XSS attacks, because scripts may be detected and blocked by client-side XSS filters. In practice, there are various methods to inject strings into the target domain, e.g. reflection of user-controlled strings or via URL parameters.

\section{Attacks} \label{sec:attacks}
In this section, we study cross-origin CSS attacks. First, we provide some background information. Next, we introduce cross-origin CSS attacks. Then, we discuss the restrictions for constructing this attack and suggest general areas that are exploitable. Finally, we demonstrate an attack against a popular web application and browser as our proof of concept.

\subsection{Background}
In this section, we provide background information about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the same-origin policy (SOP), and MIME types.

\subsubsection{Cascading Style Sheets}
Cascading Style Sheets~\cite{css} is a mechanism that lets web developers control the visual appearance of web documents using style sheet language. The design of CSS enables separation of document content from the visual appearance, including layouts, colors, and fonts. This allows web sites to adjusting its appearance, e.g. switching on-screen views to printable views, without requiring modifications to the document. Furthermore, documents are allowed to import external style sheets and let third parties to control a subset of the CSS rules. This feature allows web sites to share style sheets across a number of documents.

\paragraph{Lax Parsing}
In modern browsers, the CSS parser is actually very lax. The CSS parser will skip over any amount of invalid syntax in the style sheet until it finds the next valid rule. This is unlike the JavaScript parser that will abort on the first syntax error. A lax CSS parser gives the browser better compatibility for supporting misconfigured web sites, but unfortunately opens opportunities to attackers and enables the cross-origin CSS attack in this paper.

\todo{Chris' comment: I think they are intending to be forward-compatible with brand new CSS syntax too. There is some small interpretation of invalid syntax: careful track seems to be kept regarding opened brackets. I think this includes various bracket types -- but of course may be browser dependent. Any CSS injection point may have to close an arbitrary number of these brackets: of the correct type in the correct order!}

\subsubsection{Same-Origin Policy}
The same-origin policy~\cite{mozillasameorigin} is the main security mechanism in modern browsers that provides isolation of contents between unrelated web sites. The same-origin policy restricts contents to access resources only from the same origin, which applies to scripting interactions, i.e. accessing the Document Object Model (DOM)~\cite{dom} and transferring data using the \texttt{XMLHttpRequest} API. In SOP, the origin of a resource is defined as the protocol, host, and port. The same-origin policy does not apply to fetching and executing remote libraries, including scripts and style sheets, from a different origin.

\subsubsection{MIME Types}
The HTTP \texttt{Content-Type} header indicates the type of the content that is transmitted using Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)~\cite{mime} types such as \texttt{text/plain} for plain text and \texttt{image/jpeg} for JPEG images. The line in the HTTP header typically looks like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
\end{verbatim}
Browsers use MIME types to determine how to handle the contents of HTTP responses. However, many misconfigured web servers fail to provide the correct MIME type of their resources. Due to web site compatibility concerns, modern browsers use content-sniffing algorithms~\cite{securecontentsniffing} to guess the correct MIME type by inspecting the contents of HTTP responses.  Content-sniffing algorithms can override the provided MIME type and file extension of the document. Unfortunately, this quirk introduces chameleon documents, in which a document conforms to a benign file format (such as PDF) and contains malicious HTML.

\subsection{Cross-Origin CSS Attack}
In a cross-origin CSS attack, the attacker's main objective is to steal the victim's secret content on an honest web site from a different domain. The attacker is most likely interested in stealing any sensitive information in a cookie-authenticated web page, or preferably a secret CSRF token~\cite{csrf} hidden in the document that may allow the attacker to hijack the user's session. In order to steal content from a different domain, the attacker leverages the fact that the browser's security policy allows external style sheets to be imported from cross-origin. The target document on an honest web site is injected such that portions of the document conform to CSS rules. As soon as the victim visits the attacker's evil page, the cross-origin data is imported as style sheets and stolen. The scenario of the cross-origin CSS attack is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:scenario}. To describe the cross-origin CSS attack in detail, we decompose the attack into three main steps: CSS string injection, cross-origin CSS import, and confidential data extraction.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scenario.jpg}
\caption{Attack Scenario}
\label{figure:scenario}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CSS String Injection}
Due to lenient MIME type requirement of CSS parsers, the attacker may fool the victim's browser into loading a carefully crafted non-CSS (e.g. HTML or XML) document as a valid style sheet resource. In practice, there are several methods that may allow a web attacker to inject strings into the target domain, e.g. reflection of user-controlled strings or via URL parameters. Normally, random text in a non-CSS document contains syntax errors to the CSS parser and would break the parsing. However, due to the overly lax CSS parsers in modern browsers, portions of a non-CSS document with valid CSS syntax can still be successfully parsed and recognized as style sheet rules.

We illustrate an example of a CSS string injection in Figure~\ref{figure:injection}. Suppose that there is a sensitive content, represented with the string ``SECRET'', in an HTML document on an honest web site that the attacker wants to steal. Assuming that the attacker has sufficient influence over the web page to control the text preceding and succeeding the secret string, the CSS string injection can be constructed based on common CSS properties that have string type values, i.e. \texttt{font-family}, \texttt{background-image}, and \texttt{list-style-image}. Given the ability to inject arbitrary strings into the target domain, the HTML document can be crafted to contain a CSS property \texttt{font-family} as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
Target document:
<HTML>..SECRET..</HTML>

After injection:
<HTML>..{} BODY { font-family: "SECRET" }..</HTML>
\end{verbatim}
The injected HTML document will appear to the CSS parser as containing a valid CSS rule. The fonts of the attacker's page will be styled with a font-family specified as the stolen string ``SECRET''. Note that the seemingly redundant pair of brackets in the injection string re-syncs the CSS parser to make sure that the evil CSS rule parses properly. All the other non-CSS text in the document are skipped by the CSS parser, thus will not effect the parsing of the evil CSS rule. Once the crafted document is loaded, the attacker can easily steal the secret string from the computed \texttt{font-family} style of the attacker's page.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{injection.jpg}
\caption{CSS String Injection}
\label{figure:injection}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cross-Origin CSS Import}
When the user visits \texttt{attacker.com}, the attacker's evil page instructs the victim's browser to fetch and load the crafted document as a style sheet. In HTML specifications~\cite{html}, documents can import external style sheets from remote servers by using the CSS \texttt{@import} notation, or using the link tag inside the head element as the following: .
\begin{verbatim}
<HTML>
<HEAD>
  <STYLE>
    @import url(http://target.com);
  </STYLE>
  <LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http://target.com">
</HEAD>
</HTML>
\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Cookies}
The HTTP cookie mechanism enables web sites to authenticate clients and maintain client states, allowing web sites to not only serve static content but customize the content and appearance for each session user. According to the standards, the browser always sends the user's cookie when it loads any referenced style sheets, including cross-origin CSS. If a user was logged into the \texttt{target.com} while visiting the evil page, the browser would send the user's authentication cookie on all requests to \texttt{target.com} and be considered as valid authenticated requests. This behavior exploits cookie-authenticated web sites and potentially leaks the user's sensitive information in the server's response.

\subsubsection{Confidential Data Extraction}
The final step for the attacker is to extract the confidential data from the cross-origin imported styles in the victim's browser. The attacker's evil page can simply use JavaScript to read the computed styles. Furthermore, a variant of the cross-origin CSS attack
can extract the stolen data even with JavaScript disabled.

\paragraph{With JavaScript}
One method of data extraction is to access the computed styles or CSS text in DOM using JavaScript. All major browsers support using JavaScript to read computed styles, even loaded from cross-origin, by calling the \texttt{window.getComputedStyle} method or retrieving the \texttt{currentStyle} object. The cross-origin CSS vulnerabilities of DOM access on major browsers are shown in Table~\ref{table:DOM}. Given that the style name and property name is known, the attacker can extract the confidential data from the injected style property. WebKit-based browsers, i.e. Safari and Google Chrome, even surrendered the full CSS text of style sheets, including CSS rules loaded from cross-origin (without comments, thankfully). The attacker could read the raw text of cross-origin CSS via \texttt{document.styleSheets[].cssRules[].cssText} and also \texttt{window.getMatchedCSSRules().cssText}. This behavior violates the same-origin policy and can cause cross-origin data leak in pages with semi-valid CSS constructs. Other browsers only permit read access to the raw text of style sheets under restricted conditions. Internet Explorer allows access to cross-origin CSS raw text via \texttt{document.styleSheets[].cssText} only if the MIME type is correct. Firefox and Opera only allows access to CSS raw text for style sheets loaded from same-origin. Even if access to raw CSS text is blocked, the ability to read cross-origin loaded CSS styles is enough to construct serious attacks.

After extracting the sensitive content hidden in the style properties, the attacker can send the secret data to his own evil servers or even mount CSRF attacks. There are various methods to export data to other origins, in this specific attack we are interested in approaches where no user involvement is required, e.g. using the \texttt{XMLHttpRequest} API.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline

currentStyle&\checkmark&&\checkmark&&\\ \hline

cssRules[].cssText&&&&\checkmark&\checkmark\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\caption{Cross-Origin CSS DOM Vulnerabilities}
\label{table:DOM}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Without JavaScript}
Another method is available to exploit users that have disabled JavaScript in their browsers. The attacker can extract data without using JavaScript by injecting the CSS property \texttt{background-image} string as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
<HTML>..{} BODY { background-image: url(http://att
acker.com/?SECRET); }..</HTML>
\end{verbatim}
Using this method, the secret string is appended to the path or query string of the attacker's server URL. Therefore, the background of the attacker's page will be styled with a background image loaded from an URL, the path of which contains stolen data. One important characteristic of the CSS property \texttt{background-image}, which is an URL, is that it will be automatically fetched even if JavaScript is turned off. The stolen data is then harvested by the attacker from their web server logs.

\subsection{Attack Limitations}
The cross-origin CSS attack is less serious than it could be, because there are a few restrictions of cross-origin data which can be stolen.

\subsubsection{Insufficient Injection Points}
The first and most crucial step of the cross-origin CSS attack is to contain the secret data into a CSS property string. In order for the CSS parser to properly parse the evil CSS rule, certain symbols must be inserted at the beginning and at the end of the stolen string. In general, the attacker must have sufficient influence over the target document to control two injection points to insert the CSS property opening strings and termination strings, respectively. Typically, socially-related web sites are relatively more susceptible to this attack since the pages often contain user-controlled strings such as comments on photos. For some web sites, a second injection is not required because the termination string happens to exist later in the document. This is possible since the termination string can be as short as just a quotation mark and an ending bracket. 

\subsubsection{Character Escapes}
In CSS specifications~\cite{css}, strings can either be written with double quotes or with single quotes. Double quotes cannot occur inside double quotes, analogously for single quotes. Therefore, the attacker has the choice to inject either single or double quotes depending on the occurrence of quotes in the secret data. In a context where both quotes are escaped, it becomes more difficult to inject a CSS string. However, a variation of the attack  can bypass this restriction by injecting the CSS property \texttt{background-image}. For the \texttt{background-image} property, the URL value is written with the functional notation \texttt{url()}, which does not require the use of single or double quotes around the URL string itself. The CSS specification does define that certain characters must be escaped in an unquoted URL, e.g. parentheses, commas, white spaces, single quotes and double quotes. However, in Internet Explorer, the CSS parser does not require any of these characters to be escaped in an unquoted URL and will parse until it encounters a closing parentheses and a semicolon.

\paragraph{Forcing UTF-7}
The requirement for quotes to not get escaped can sometimes be bypassed in browsers that support UTF-7 encoding, including Firefox and Safari. If the target web sites fails to specify a character set in the HTTP \texttt{Content-Type} header, the attacker's evil page can force the remote resource to be parsed as UTF-7 encoding as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
<LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http://target.com"
CHARSET="utf-7">
\end{verbatim}
By forcing UTF7, either a single or double quote may be injected by rendering it in the UTF-7 character set, i.e. ``\texttt{+ACc-}'' for single quote and ``\texttt{+ACI-}'' for double quote. This will cause the injection to survive any output escaping of the web application. A significant number of web sites actually do not specify character sets in their HTTP responses (We found that 22 out of the top 100 web sites ranked by Alexa~\cite{alexa} did not specify character sets). Some web sites specify the \texttt{Content-Type} information using meta tags with the \texttt{http-equiv} attribute in the HTML head element as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;
charset=utf-8">
\end{verbatim}
Browsers may use meta tags to refine the information provided by the actual headers, but can also ignore it. If a document declares a character set in a meta tag but not in the response header, the referring page can override the character set with the \texttt{charset} attribute in the parent link tag. Thus, using the equivalent HTTP header to specify the MIME type and character set is always recommended.

\subsubsection{Newlines}
In CSS, a string cannot directly contain a newline. To include a newline in a string, the line feed character must be escaped. Therefore, another barrier of this attack is that any un-escaped newline in the stolen string will break the CSS parsing. This is a very common condition in many web pages, which avoids potentially serious attacks. However, many rich-functionality web sites are often exploitable due to serving subtle cookie-authenticated URLs with JSON or XML responses that commonly lack newlines. Some web sites even allow users to control the formatting of server responses, e.g. disable pretty printing, which may be extremely dangerous.
\paragraph{Internet Explorer}
Catastrophically, the CSS parser in the Internet Explorer accepts both newlines in CSS strings and newlines in unquoted URL strings, regardless of whether escaped or not. Unfortunately, even a fully-patched browser can expose its users to a cross-origin CSS data theft and potentially serious session hijacking.

\subsection{Example Attacks?}
In this section, we present an example of the cross-origin CSS attack using e-mail subject string injection on a popular web mail application and steal data from victims using the Internet Explorer browser.

\paragraph{Yahoo! Mail} Yahoo! Mail is a free web mail service that lets users send and receive e-mails using any popular web browser with cookies and JavaScript enabled. After a user signs in with a valid account, the web site will authenticate the user with browser session cookies for as long as two weeks without signing out. Targeting the web mail home page, the attacker can mount an attack on victims that are signed into their accounts with the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The attacker sends an evil e-mail to the victim's account with a CSS property termination string in the subject, such as `\texttt{);\}}'.}
\item{The attacker waits for sensitive e-mails to fill the victim's inbox.}
\item{The attacker sends another evil e-mail to the victim's account with a CSS property opening string in the subject, such as `\texttt{\{\}body\{background-image:url(}'.}
\item{The victim visits \texttt{attacker.com}, which triggers the cross-origin CSS attack and steals secret data from the victim's inbox.}
\end{enumerate}
The attacker's evil page references the URL of web mail home page as a CSS resource and extracts the stolen data from the computed \texttt{background-image} style using JavaScript, as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http://mail.yahoo.com">
<SCRIPT>
function steal() {
alert(document.body.currentStyle['backgroundImage']);
}
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY onLoad="steal()">
</BODY>
</HTML>
\end{verbatim}
In this example, the victim's browser will popup an alert message that contains some stolen cross-origin text. Within the stolen text contains the subjects, senders and the ``mid'' value for all e-mails received between the two evil e-mails were delivered to the victim. The ``mid'' value would appear to be an unguessable key to an attacker. Accordingly, it is reasonable for the mail application to rely on it as a secret token to defend CSRF attacks. This is indeed the case for the e-mail deletion operation, implemented as an HTTP GET request. This example demonstrates the potential severity of the cross-origin CSS attack, by leaking only a small amount of cross-domain text may proceed to more serious attacks and possibly session hijacking. Many social networking sites are vulnerable to variants of this attack, where the attacker gets to leave arbitrary text comments which are rendered on the victim's trusted page.

\paragraph{UTF-7 Attack?}


\section{Defenses} \label{sec:defenses}
In this section, we describe the defenses against cross-orgin CSS attacks. First, we propose to apply stricter browser requirements for loading cross-origin CSS references. Next, we present an evaluation of web site compatibility for our proposal. Then, we state the progress of adoption for our proposal in major browsers. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of other defensive approaches, including client-side and server-side mitigations.

\subsection{Proposal: Cross-Origin CSS Checking}
To prevent cross-origin CSS attacks, we propose that browsers should apply stricter checking when loading cross-origin CSS files. Our initial approach is to enforce strict MIME type checking for loading cross-origin CSS files, we refer as the strict approach. We devise a conservative approach with additional CSS parser testing that maximizes web site compatibility while blocking most attacks.

\subsubsection{Strict Approach}
In the cross-origin CSS attack, the attacker's evil web page confuses the victim's browser to parse an injected non-CSS document as a style sheet. If browsers strictly required external style sheets to specify the correct MIME type, which is \texttt{text/css}, the evil web page would not be able to load any crafted document. One effective solution is to let browsers always check the MIME type of external CSS references and block any CSS load with an invalid MIME type. When strict MIME type checking is enforced, at least for cross-origin CSS loads (if not globally), browsers would be able to protect target non-CSS documents from being stolen.

The major concern of the strict approach is that any misconfigured cross-origin resources that fail to provide valid MIME types would be blocked. Strict MIME type checking relies on web developers to correctly deploy their web sites and provide valid MIME types. Unless every web developer properly configures their servers to send the correct \texttt{Content-Type} response header, the strict approach will inevitably introduce false positives and cause CSS failure on web sites. Expectedly, browser vendors would tend to resist changes that would cause web site breakage and lose its users.

\paragraph{Strict Mode}
In fact, most modern browsers have a strict mode, or standard-compliant mode, that always require the correct MIME type when loading CSS files. However, strict modes are only triggered when the web developer declares a document type definition (DTD) in the referring document. Otherwise, the quirks mode, or compatibility mode, is used by default for better backward-compatibility. The strict mode option is not a mitigation to the cross-origin CSS attack because the attacker can simply avoid enabling strict mode by not declaring a doctype in their malicious documents. For web developers, it is always recommended to develop standard compliant web pages and add a \texttt{doctype} declaration at the beginning of the document to instruct the browser which version of the markup language you are using, as the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
 "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Conservative Approach}
To address web site compatibility concerns, we propose a conservative approach that blocks most attacks while tolerating some common MIME type misconfigurations. In order to reduce false positives in the strict MIME type approach, an additional level of checking is applied to cross-origin CSS loads that have invalid MIME types. When a valid MIME type is not provided, the browser will try to parse the cross-origin CSS but bails on first syntax error. This simple parsing test helps to determine whether the imported CSS file is an injected target document. Therefore, the devised solution blocks a CSS load only when all of the following conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The CSS load is a cross-origin reference.}
\item{The CSS load has an invalid MIME type for CSS.}
\item{The alleged CSS file does not start with a syntactically valid CSS construct.}
\end{itemize}
The above rules will block most cross-origin CSS attacks because the target documents that are not CSS files have headers that will cause a broken first CSS descriptor, e.g. HTML or XML headers. We also assume that a legitimate CSS file will unlikely have a syntax error at the beginning of the file and a broken MIME type, thus this heuristic should not break most existing sites. Only CSS files loaded from cross-origin with invalid MIME type that starts with malformed syntax is determined as an attacked document and rejected.

\subsubsection{Experiment}
To evaluate the compatibility of our proposed defense of stricter CSS loading, we conducted an experiment to measure how often web servers fail to provide the correct MIME type for CSS files and whether these CSS files are well-formed when loaded cross-origin.

\paragraph{Design}
To measure how often web servers fail to provide the correct MIME type for CSS files, we collected metrics by crawling the top 10,000 web sites ranked by Alexa~\cite{alexa} and scanned through all of the style sheet resources in their home pages. We are interested in all CSS references including using HTML link tags and CSS \texttt{@import} directives. Furthermore, some web sites dynamically add CSS links using JavaScript while the page loads. To achieve a more thorough scan for these CSS references, we conducted our experiment to directly render these web pages with an instrumented WebKit browser while recording information of all CSS loads until the web page finishes loading.

\paragraph{Results}
From the top 10,000 web sites, we fetched a total of 27532 CSS references, including 22799 link tags and 4733 \texttt{@import} directives. These results do not include unreachable web sites nor unreachable CSS resources.

We found that as many as 172 CSS references on these popular sites did not provide the correct \texttt{Content-Type} response header. In most cases, we found that misconfigured servers provided the \texttt{text/html} MIME type for CSS files, which is normally for HTML documents. Some CSS files did not specify the \texttt{Content-Type} header in the response at all, thus had an empty MIME type. Our browser collected a list of various incorrect MIME types for CSS files, including \texttt{text/html}, \texttt{text/plain}, \texttt{text}, \texttt{application/octet-stream}, \texttt{application/x-pointplus}, \texttt{image/gif}, \texttt{Content-Type:text/css} and empty MIME type. The common misconfigured MIME types for CSS resources in the top 10,000 web sites are shown in Table~\ref{table:MIME}.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
Content-Type&Percentage\\ \hline

\subsubsection{Experiment}
To evaluate the compatibility of our proposed defense of stricter CSS loading, we conducted an experiment to measure how often web servers fail to provide the correct MIME type for CSS files and whether these CSS files are well-formed when loaded cross-origin.

\paragraph{Design}
To measure how often web servers fail to provide the correct MIME type for CSS files, we collected metrics by crawling the top 10,000 web sites ranked by Alexa\cite{alexa} and scanned through all of the style sheet resources in their home pages. We are interested in all CSS references including using HTML link tags and CSS \texttt{@import} directives. Furthermore, some web sites dynamically add CSS links using JavaScript while the page loads. To achieve a more thorough scan for these CSS references, we conducted our experiment to directly render these web pages with an instrumented WebKit browser while recording information of all CSS loads until the web page finishes loading.

\paragraph{Results}
From the top 10,000 web sites, we fetched a total of 27532 CSS references, including 22799 link tags and 4733 \texttt{@import} directives. These results do not include unreachable web sites nor unreachable CSS resources.
Our results are shown in Table~\ref{table:MIME}.

We found that as many as 172 CSS references on these popular sites did not provide the correct \texttt{Content-Type} response header. In most cases, we found that misconfigured servers provided the \texttt{text/html} MIME type for CSS files, which is for normal HTML documents. Some CSS files did not specify the \texttt{Content-Type} header in the response at all, thus had an empty MIME type. Our browser collected a list of various incorrect MIME types for CSS files, including \texttt{text/html}, \texttt{text/plain}, \texttt{text}, \texttt{application/octet-stream}, \texttt{application/x-pointplus}, \texttt{image/gif}, \texttt{Content-Type:text/css} and empty MIME type.

According to the CSS parser of WebKit, our browser reported that 93 CSS files were mal-formed, which fail to have a syntactically valid CSS construct at the beginning to the file. There were three CSS files that were mal-formed and also have a broken MIME type, however none of these CSS files were cross-origin loads.

Within a total of 8352 cross-origin CSS loads, there were 40 of them that had a broken MIME type. Blocking these loads would cause CSS failure on 32 of the 10000 most popular web sites. However, we also observed that none of the cross-origin CSS files with broken MIME types were mal-formed.

%We ran a scan across the top 500,000 URLs looking for cross-origin loads of CSS with an invalid MIME type. Valid MIME types are defined as text/css, application/x-unknown-content-type, and empty. There were a total of 140 URLs detected that referenced cross-origin CSS with broken MIME types. We found that some of them were non-serious conditions, in which the site loaded a CSS file which is missing and redirected to a 404 html page. There were 60 URLs that would be considered as broken, including 13 with text/plain, 15 with text/html, 31 with application/css, and 1 with application/x-pointplus. If we apply the heuristics of the conservative approach, only one URL that served text/html MIME would fail to load, which was severely broken because it had valid CSS rules after a style tag.

\paragraph{Discussion}
Based on our results, deploying the strict approach would break CSS references on 0.32\% of the top web sites. Although not prominent, we expect that if any popular web site did not render properly due to stricter CSS loading, browser vendors would possibly resist to deploy this change in risk of losing its users. Our data also suggests that misconfigured servers commonly send the \texttt{text/html} MIME type regardless of the served content type.

In our observations, the conservative approach did not break a single CSS reference in the top 10000 web sites. The conservative approach is an appealing defense because it maximizes web site compatibility while blocking the cross-origin CSS attack.

Due to practical limitations of our automated scanning, all of the tested links were unauthenticated. It is possible that more sites will be broken after logging in.

\subsubsection{Adoption}
Our proposal has been adopted by several major browsers, including Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and Firefox. Our proposal requires no changes to existing web servers and only modifies the browser. We implemented the conservative approach of stricter CSS loading in a patch to WebKit, the open source web browser engine component integrated in Safari and Google Chrome. The WebKit patch was first deployed in Google Chrome 4.0.249.78, and also accepted in Safari 4.0.5. Note that the cross-origin CSS raw text leak is tightened by this patch because read access to cross-origin CSS raw text is limited to well-formed imports. Inspired by our WebKit patch, the exact same heuristic was adopted in Opera 10.10. Mozilla adopted the strict approach for loading cross-origin CSS files in Firefox 3.7.

The interpretation of valid MIME types for cross-origin CSS on each browser slightly differs as shown in Table~\ref{table:adoption}. All browsers allow the correct \texttt{text/css} MIME type, Firefox and WebKit-based browsers also defaultly accept files with empty string or \texttt{application/x-unknown-content-type} MIME type, which are normally used to trigger the browser's content-sniffing algorithm. We noticed that Firefox 3.7 allows some unknown MIME types such as \texttt{*/*} and also bogus MIME types that lack a slash such as \texttt{text}. Known MIME types represent all the predefined MIME types for common media types with the exception of \texttt{text/css}, such as \texttt{text/html} and \texttt{image/gif}.

\subsection{Other Approaches}
In this section, we further discuss some possible solutions to defend against the cross-origin CSS attack that we have considered. We argue that all of these approaches could either be circumvented with a variation of the attack, or would significantly reduce web site compatibility.

\subsubsection{Client-side Defenses}
There are other approaches that can be deployed in browsers without modifying web servers including globally blocking cookies, tightening DOM access and enforce stricter CSS parsing.

\paragraph{Block Cookies}
Browsers give users the option of disabling cookies and always send anonymous requests, thus can prevent web attackers from stealing content on any cookie-authenticated URLs. However, session cookies are often used by web sites to control the response of each user's request and provide user-specific styles, e.g. adjusting to mobile account or printable view. Disabling cookies would literally break a huge amount of sites that requires logging in. A more conservative approach would be to prevent sending cookies when sending requests for cross-origin CSS. However, that would still crash legitimate web sites that provide user-specific styles using external style sheets.

\paragraph{Restrict DOM Access}
The same-origin policy for DOM access restricts the ability for JavaScript to access DOM properties and methods across domains. To prevent the cross-origin CSS attack, browsers should cautiously block DOM access to style sheets loaded from cross-origin, at least when the CSS file is malformed or has incorrect MIME type. However, all major browsers grant read access to computed styles loaded from cross-origin using either \texttt{window.getComputedStyle} or \texttt{currentStyle}, violating the same-origin policy. Even if browsers restricted the read access to computed styles for cross-origin loads, the attacker could bypass this limitation with \texttt{background-image} property injection that could automatically export data in requests to cross-origin servers.

\paragraph{Stricter CSS Parsing}
CSS parsers are tolerant of syntax errors and will resume parsing after syntax errors. The cross-origin CSS attack could be mitigated if the browser's CSS parser always crashed hard on the first syntax error, like JavaScript parsers. However, this approach would require all web developers to strictly write well formed CSS, and would immediately break many existing web sites.

\subsubsection{Server-side Mitigations}
There are also some approaches that can be applied on web servers without requiring changes to current browsers, including using newlines, escaping characters and not using cookies.

\paragraph{Newlines}
In the CSS specifications, strings cannot directly contain newlines. Thus, a method to interfere the cross-origin CSS attack is to use newlines in sensitive web content. In most browsers, newlines will break CSS parsing and fail to load the cross-origin data. However, the Internet Explorer allows newlines within CSS property strings. With the existence of non-standard quirks in different browser implementations, a web site will not be able to completely protect its content from being stolen by solely using newlines.

\paragraph{Escaping Characters}
The CSS specification defined that strings should be enclosed within either single quotes or double quotes. Another protection for web applications could be forcing escaping quotes in every reflected user-controlled content. The CSS parsing for a string would break if it was not written in un-escaped quotes. However, the attacker could bypass this barrier by injecting the \texttt{background-image} property which allows embedding strings within the \texttt{url()} notation without using quotes.

\paragraph{Don't Use Ambient Authentication}
The cross-origin CSS attack could be mitigated if web applications do not use ambient authentication, including HTTP authentication and session cookies. One solution is the web-key authentication scheme~\cite{webkey} which explicitly embeds user permissions in URLs without using cookies for authentication. This approach can mitigate the attack since the attacker does not know the unguessable URL. However, integrating the web-key mechanism into existing web applications is a non-trivial task for web developers.

\section{Related Work} \label{sec:relatedwork}
In this section, we relate some current browser defense techniques that are used to defend against similar attacks including content-sniffing XSS and JavaScript Hijacking. We also inspect Microsoft's proposal of a secure web browser and its protection against the cross-origin CSS attack.

\subsection{Content-Sniffing XSS Defenses}
In a content-sniffing XSS attack, the attacker uploads a crafted chameleon document that conforms to a benign file format (e.g. JPEG or PDF) to an honest web site and causes the victim user's browser to treat the file as HTML and renders the attacker's evil page in the honest site's domain. Such vulnerabilities are caused by discrepancies between the browser's content-sniffing algorithm and the web site's upload filter. A secure content-sniffing algorithm~\cite{securecontentsniffing} was proposed to protect web sites from this attack by avoiding privilege escalation and using prefix-disjoint signatures. The \texttt{X-Content-Type-Options} header~\cite{nosniff} proposed by Microsoft allows web sites to opt-out of MIME sniffing in supporting browsers by specifying the \texttt{nosniff} directive in the HTTP response header. However, this approach requires modifications to all web sites and web browsers to completely mitigate the content-sniffing XSS attack. Neither the secure content-sniffing algorithm nor the \texttt{nosniff} directive is triggered for loading style sheets, thus both approaches do not prevent the cross-origin CSS attack.

\subsection{JavaScript Hijacking Defenses}
JavaScript Hijacking~\cite{jshijacking} is a vulnerability that allows the attacker to steal sensitive data from an honest web site that uses JavaScript as data transport format, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) messages. Since the browser security model allows importing scripts from a different domain, the attacker can use a script tag in their evil page to include the target JavaScript object. A client-side mitigation is to prevent direct execution of the responses by prefixing each JavaScript object with a \texttt{while(1);} statement. The malicious page using script tag will execute the infinite loop while the legitimate client application can modify the response before executing it. A server-side defense approach is to block malicious requests by including secret tokens in every legitimate request, which can not be forged by the attacker. Another server-side technique to block JavaScript Hijacking attacks is responding only to HTTP POST requests because the script tag always uses GET requests to load external libraries. These server-side mitigations can also be used in defense of the cross-origin CSS attack, but puts the burden on web developers to implement secure applications.

\subsection{Gazelle Browser}
The Gazelle browser~\cite{gazelle} is proposed as a secure web browser that exclusively controls resource protection and sharing across web sites, or principals, as a multi-principal OS. In their architecture, all cross-principal communication are explicitly mediated by the browser kernel to prevent cross-origin attacks. Thus, cross-origin resources are protected and only retrieved if the content is a script or a style sheet based on the Content-Type header of the HTTP response. Gazelle provides the same protection against cross-origin CSS attacks as the strict MIME type checking approach at the cost of site incompatibility. From our compatibility evaluation results, the strict approach would cause CSS failure on 32 of the top 10,000 web sites.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed browser defenses to provide robust defense for the cross-origin CSS attack. We presented two defensive approaches, the strict approach based on MIME type checking and the conservative approach using additional CSS parser testing to address web site compatibility issues. We evaluated the compatibility of our proposed solution over the top 10,000 web sites. Without relying on web site modifications, the conservative approach completely mitigates the attack while maximizing site compatibility. We found that common server misconfigurations introduced false positives in the strict approach, that would cause 0.32\% sites to render incorrectly. We recommend that web administrators should properly configure servers to provide correct MIME types to reduce false positives. Our proposal has been adopted in sereral major browsers including Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and Firefox.
