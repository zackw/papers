\section{Conclusion}\label{s:conclusion}
We described StegoTorus, a new system for improving Tor's robustness
against automated protocol analysis.  StegoTorus interposes on
communications between the Tor client and the first Tor relay,
implements a custom encryption protocol and provides a suite of
steganography modules that make Tor resilient to fingerprinting
attacks.  Our statistical evaluations demonstrate that StegoTorus
makes Tor traffic more resilient to site fingerprinting attacks and
and that it resembles HTTP in the dimensions of connection length,
payload size and bandwidth use.  Our performance measurements indicate
that our prototype system, in its HTTP steganography mode, delivers
throughput of roughly \kBps{30}, which is about four times that of a
\kbps{56} modem.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Future Work:} There is much room for
further research on expanding and strengthening our suite of
steganography modules.  Beyond steganography modules we plan to
explore opportunities for performance improvements and add support for
redundant coding among steganography modules.
