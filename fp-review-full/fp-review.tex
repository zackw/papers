\section{Introduction}

Most off-the-shelf secure network protocols provide some form of the
conceptual \emph{secure channel} for passing messages back and forth
between two endpoints.  A secure channel offers three security
guarantees: \emph{confidentiality}---an attacker cannot observe the
content of messages in transit; \emph{integrity}---an attacker cannot
modify messages in transit; and \emph{authenticity}---an attacker
cannot impersonate either endpoint.  These guarantees collectively
offer a solid foundation for secure application development, but they
are not sufficient for complete security in all situations.

\subsection{Unlinkable Channels}

Even with a secure channel in place, an eavesdropper can easily learn
the origin and destination addresses of each packet, the amount of
application data it carries, its position within a TCP stream, and
other metainformation, such as any TCP options that are present.  Of
this information, the origin and destination are most sensitive;
sometimes the information that Alice did at some point talk to Bob is
enough to send Alice to prison!\footnote{As an extreme example, the
  Soviet Union notoriously criminalized “contacts leading to suspicion
  of espionage.”~\needcite{solzhenitsyn?}}  An \emph{unlinkable
  channel} is a secure channel that passes through one or more relay
hosts, so that an eavesdropper at any single point in the network
cannot tell that the endpoints are communicating with each other.  At
most, the eavesdropper will know that one of the endpoints is
communicating with one of the relays.  This is the additional security
guarantee of \emph{unlinkability}~\cite{pfitzmann2010terminology}.

The secure channel within an unlinkable channel is established
end-to-end, so the relay(s) cannot themselves eavesdrop; however, if
there is only one relay (this style of unlinkable channel is commonly
known as a \emph{proxy server}), the relay itself knows both the
source and the destination of each message.  Even if run by people
with the best of intentions, a proxy server is vulnerable to offline
coercion to expose that information. \todo{something about
  anon.penet.fi here}.  A \emph{mix network}~\needcite{chaum1978}
replaces the single relay with a chain of relays, each of which knows
only the previous and next hop; subverting any one relay thus reveals
no more than eavesdropping would have. \todo{Explain why three relays
  are used in practice.}  Some of the research we review studied the
behavior of proxy servers, while other papers examined mix networks.
We will refer to both as unlinkable channels except where the
difference matters.

Unlinkable channels don't generally conceal the size or the timing of
messages.  There are exceptions: Chaum's original mix design (intended
for email) did include substantial delays at each relay in order to
conceal timing, but this is not considered acceptable for modern
interactive protocols such as HTTP: current-generation mix networks,
such as Tor~\cite{dingledine2004tor}, treat their \emph{low latency}
as a valuable feature.  Unlinkable channels may or may not disguise
the TCP session to which each packet belongs.

\subsection{Traffic Analysis}

Traffic analysis is the craft of deducing information about the
content of a secret message from what is still observable.
Classically, this was its origin, destination, timing, and
relationship to other events: for instance, if we overhear an
encrypted radio message directed to a naval base, and shortly
thereafter an aircraft carrier group leaves that base, we can deduce
that the message was orders for that carrier group.  In a modern
packet-switched network, traffic analysis relies on message size and
timing.  Packet sizes may be used directly, or may be aggregated to
estimate the size of a higher-level message, such as an HTTP
transaction.  TCP control bits can also reveal higher-level message
boundaries.

A traffic-analytic attacker on an unlinkable channel is generally
assumed to be eavesdropping at a point where it can observe one
endpoint of the channel.  It can observe but not modify the traffic to
and from its victim.  It is also allowed to send and receive traffic
of its own to public and attacker-controlled servers, and to make use
of the same unlinkable-channel relays as the victim, but not to
subvert the operation of those relays.  It may or may not be able to
communicate overtly with the victim (for instance by enticing the
victim to visit an attacker-operated website), and it may or may not
operate its own malicious relays.

The attacker's goal may be to determine the other endpoint or to learn
something about the content of the traffic.  \todo{Discuss VoIP
  decoding from VBR packet size.}  If the attacker operates malicious
relays, it may also seek to discover whether a particular victim is
sending traffic through those relays. \todo{Expand on bootstrapping
  single-point surveillance to distributed traffic correlation.}
