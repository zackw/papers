\section{Results}\label{s:eval}

With every page assigned a topic, we can now look at how topics
correlate with the lists the pages came from, and the languages
they're written in.  With information about when pages went offline or
changed their topic, we can also predict the typical lifetime of
classes of pages.

%% Diagnostic: do our topics agree with CitizenLab's labels, where pages
%% overlap?

%% Diagnostic: time density of wayback-machine snapshots as a function of
%% page age and topic (and Alexa rank?)

%% For each source, survival curves.

%% For each topic, survival curves.

%% Topic-source correlogram.

%% Source-source correlogram, using topic distribution as the vectors to
%% correlate.

%% Identify topics that are over-represented in “leak” sources, relative
%% to Common Crawl /Alexa /Herdict(?) /Twitter(?).

%% Partition Herdict into cohorts and compare it with itself.

%% Go back in time from the entered-onto-blacklist event, see how long
%% the document had that topic before it came to censors' attention.

%% Model: probability that a page will get censored, conditional on
%% topic, as a function of its age.  Competing risk: other causes of page
%% going away.  Alexa rank as additional independent variable?


%% How far is our closest datapoint (from the wayback machine) is from
%% the time it entered a blacklist.

%% An interesting comparison would be to compare how much ONI data vs our
%% optimized list would cover from a known leaked censorship list.
