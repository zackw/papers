\section{Document preprocessing}\label{s:preprocessing}

Having collected pages, we wish to reason about their contents.  For
example, we wish to assign a topic to each page, and detect when this
topic changes.  With hundreds of thousands of pages collected, this
process must be automated as much as possible.

The principal technique we use is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
clustering~\cite{lda_original2003}.  Our analysis pipeline
(illustrated in Figure~\ref{f:pipeline}) includes several heuristic
filtering steps before LDA, which remove irrelevant “boilerplate”
and reduce the cost of model training.  These are described in this
section, and LDA itself is described in Section~\ref{s:analysis}.
