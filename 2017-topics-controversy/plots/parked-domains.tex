Contemporary data collection retrieved a non-empty, non-error HTML
page for 436,832 of the 758,191 unique URLs in our full data set
(57.6\%).  The classifier identified 30,508 (7.0\%) of these pages as
parked domains.

Parked domains also appear in the historical data.  The Wayback
Machine provided us with 2,742,788 snapshots of 423,236 URLs.  Of
those snapshots, 2,486,426 (90.7\%) were non-empty and not error
pages, and the classifier identified 54,710 (2.2\%) of these as parked
domains.  23,687 (5.6\%) of the 423,236 URLs were parked at least once
in their history.
