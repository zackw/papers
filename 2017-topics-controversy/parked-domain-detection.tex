\subsection{Parked Domain Detection}
\label{s:parked_domain}

A \emph{parked domain} is a placeholder website, operated by a
\emph{domain parker}, who hopes to sell the domain name eventually.
It contains no meaningful content, only advertising banners and
links~\cite{vissers2015parking}. Domain parkers often claim the names
of abandoned websites, hoping to gain from visits by people looking
for the former occupant.  The placeholder site will bear little or no
relationship to the content of the website that used to be there.
However, it may parrot keywords from search queries that lead to the
site.  This confuses LDA, which cannot tell that the words are being
repeated meaninglessly.

Therefore, we identify parked domains using a dedicated, heuristic
classifier and exclude them from topic analysis.  We tested two such
classifiers from the literature~\cite{vissers2015parking,
  szurdi2014long} and selected the one that performed best on our
data; see Appendix~\ref{s:pdd-eval} for details.
